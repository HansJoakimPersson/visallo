Visallo is an extensible investigative and analytic platform for both
structured and unstructered data with a graph database back end. This
documentation should help you [get Visallo running locally](development/quick-start.md)
so you can see how it works and to [develop extenstions](development/extend.md).
If you have any problems along the way be sure to see [how to get help](help.md).
