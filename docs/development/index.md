# Visallo Development

You may want to extend Visallo to add you own custom features or even
[contribute](https://github.com/v5analytics/visallo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to the open source project. Either way, review the [devleopment dependencies](dependencies.md)
and then the [quick start instructions](quick-start.md).

After you have Visallo running you may want to review the
[architecture](architecture.md), [data model](data-model.md) and
[ontology](ontology/index.md) so you know how the different
components of Visallo work together.

We've developed several [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) to show you
what you can do next as well as extensive documentation of
[configuration settins](configuration.md),
[plugin interfaces](../plugin-interfaces/index.md), and
[web extention points](../web-entension-points/index.md).

If you have any problems along the way be sure to see
[how to get help](../help.md).
